My name is Mitchell Achor and I am a student at Seminole State College of Florida studying Information Systems with a concentration in programming. I have 1 year of experience in programming with Java. Other languages I have used include HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Swift, and GDScript. 
I will be using this respository for practicing and learning git and GitHub.
